# Plan Before Multi-Step Execution

For complex tasks, plan first and execute second.

**Planning phase:**
1. Decompose the task into concrete, ordered steps.
2. Identify dependencies between steps.
3. Flag irreversible actions that need user confirmation.
4. Identify what can fail and what the recovery path is.

**Execution phase:**
- Follow the plan step by step; update it if you discover new information.
- After each step, verify the expected output before proceeding.
- If a step fails, re-evaluate the remaining plan — don't blindly continue.

**Anti-pattern:** Starting to execute before understanding the full scope of the task.
