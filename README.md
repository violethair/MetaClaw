## 🔥 News

- **[03/13/2026]** **v0.3** — Continual meta-learning support: slow RL updates now only run during sleep hours, idle time, or Google Calendar meetings. Added support/query set separation to prevent stale reward signals from polluting model updates.
- **[03/11/2026]** **v0.2** — One-click deployment via `metaclaw` CLI. Skills enabled by default, RL is now opt-in.
- **[03/09/2026]** We release **MetaClaw** — Just talk to your agent and let it evolve automatically. **NO** GPU deployment required; just plug into the **API**.

## 📖 Overview

**MetaClaw is an agent that meta-learns and evolves in the wild.**
Just talk to your agent as you normally would — MetaClaw turns every live conversation into a learning signal, enabling the agent to continuously improve through real-world deployment rather than offline training alone.

Under the hood, it places your model behind an OpenAI-compatible proxy that intercepts interactions from OpenClaw, injects relevant skills at each turn, and meta-learns from accumulated experience. Skills are summarized automatically after each session; with RL enabled, a meta-learning scheduler defers weight updates to idle windows so the agent is never interrupted during active use.

No GPU cluster required. MetaClaw works with any OpenAI-compatible LLM API out of the box, and optionally integrates **Kimi-K2.5** (1T MoE) via [Tinker](https://www.thinkingmachines.ai/tinker/) for cloud-based LoRA training.

## 🤖 Key Features

### **One-click deployment**
Configure once with `metaclaw setup`, then `metaclaw start` brings up the proxy, injects skills, and wires OpenClaw automatically. No manual shell scripts needed.

### **Three operating modes**

| Mode | Default | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `madmax` | ✅ | RL + smart scheduler. Skills always on; RL weight updates only run during sleep/idle/meeting windows. |
| `rl` | — | RL without scheduler. Trains immediately when a batch is full (original v0.2 behavior). |
| `skills_only` | — | Proxy → your LLM API. Skills injected, auto-summarized after each session. No GPU/Tinker required. |

### **Skill injection**
At every turn, MetaClaw retrieves the most relevant skill instructions and injects them into the agent's system prompt. Immediate behavior improvement without retraining.

### **Automatic skill summarization**
After each conversation, the same LLM you're already using analyzes the session and distills new skills automatically. With RL enabled, a dedicated judge model extracts skills from failed episodes.

### **No GPU cluster required**
In `skills_only` mode, only a network connection is needed. RL training is offloaded to Tinker cloud.

### **Two learning modes**
MetaClaw supports both:
- **RL (GRPO)** for learning from implicit feedback signals
- **On-Policy Distillation (OPD)** for distilling a larger teacher model into the student on-policy

In OPD mode, the student generates responses as usual, and a teacher model provides per-token log-probabilities on those same responses. The teacher logprobs are passed to the loss function (e.g., `cispo`) so the student learns to match the teacher's distribution. The teacher must be served behind an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/completions` endpoint (e.g., vLLM, SGLang).

### **Asynchronous by design**
Serving, reward modeling, and training are fully decoupled. The agent continues responding while scoring and optimization run in parallel.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install -e .                        # skills_only mode (lightweight)
pip install -e ".[rl]"                  # + RL training support (torch, transformers, tinker)
pip install -e ".[evolve]"              # + skill evolution via OpenAI-compatible LLM
pip install -e ".[scheduler]"           # + Google Calendar integration for scheduler
pip install -e ".[rl,evolve,scheduler]" # recommended for full RL + scheduler setup
```

### 2. Configure

```bash
metaclaw setup
```

The interactive wizard will ask you to choose your LLM provider (Kimi, Qwen, MiniMax, or custom), enter your API key, and optionally enable RL training.

### 3. Start

```bash
metaclaw start
```

That's it. MetaClaw starts the proxy, automatically configures OpenClaw to use it, and restarts the gateway. Open OpenClaw and start chatting — skills are injected at every turn, and the session is automatically summarized into new skills when you're done.

## 💪 Skills

Skills are short Markdown instructions injected into the agent's system prompt at each turn. They live in your skills directory (`~/.metaclaw/skills/` by default), organized as individual `SKILL.md` files.

**Skill auto-summarization** runs after each conversation. The LLM you configured analyzes what happened and generates new skills automatically. No manual curation needed — the library grows with your usage.

To pre-load the built-in skill bank (40+ skills across coding, security, agentic tasks, etc.):

```bash
cp -r memory_data/skills/* ~/.metaclaw/skills/
```

---

## 🔬 Advanced: RL Mode

Enable RL training to continuously fine-tune the model from live conversations:

```bash
metaclaw config rl.enabled true
metaclaw config rl.tinker_api_key sk-...
metaclaw config rl.prm_url https://api.openai.com/v1
metaclaw config rl.prm_api_key sk-...
metaclaw start
```

In RL mode:
- Each conversation turn is tokenized and submitted as a training sample
- A judge LLM (PRM) scores responses asynchronously
- Tinker cloud runs LoRA fine-tuning; updated weights are hot-swapped every `batch_size` samples
- A dedicated evolver LLM extracts new skills from failed episodes

**Programmatic rollout** (no OpenClaw TUI needed): set `openclaw_env_data_dir` to a directory of JSONL task files:

```json
{"task_id": "task_1", "instruction": "Register the webhook at https://example.com/hook"}
```

---

## 🔬 Advanced: OPD Mode

On-Policy Distillation (OPD) lets you distill a larger teacher model into the student while it trains on-policy. The student generates responses as usual; the teacher provides per-token log-probabilities on those same responses. A KL penalty steers the student toward the teacher's distribution.

```bash
metaclaw config opd.enabled true
metaclaw config opd.teacher_url http://localhost:8082/v1
metaclaw config opd.teacher_model Qwen/Qwen3-32B
metaclaw config opd.kl_penalty_coef 1.0
metaclaw start --mode rl
```

The teacher must be served behind an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/completions` endpoint (e.g., vLLM, SGLang). OPD can be combined with PRM scoring — both run asynchronously.

See `examples/run_conversation_opd.py` for a programmatic example and `scripts/run_openclaw_tinker_opd.sh` for a ready-made launch script.

---

## 🧠 Advanced: Meta-Learning Scheduler (v0.3)

In RL mode, the weight hot-swap step pauses the agent for several minutes. The scheduler (enabled by default in `madmax` mode) defers RL updates to user-inactive windows so the agent is never interrupted during active use.

```bash
metaclaw config scheduler.sleep_start "23:00"
metaclaw config scheduler.sleep_end   "07:00"
metaclaw config scheduler.idle_threshold_minutes 30

# Optional: Google Calendar integration
pip install -e ".[scheduler]"
metaclaw config scheduler.calendar.enabled true
metaclaw config scheduler.calendar.credentials_path ~/.metaclaw/client_secrets.json
```

Three conditions trigger an update window (any one is sufficient): configured sleep hours, system keyboard inactivity, or an active Google Calendar event. If the user returns mid-update, the partial batch is saved and resumed at the next window.

Each `ConversationSample` is tagged with a `skill_generation` version. When skill evolution bumps the generation, the RL buffer is flushed so only post-evolution samples are used for gradient updates (MAML support/query set separation).
